This package (app/java/org.achartengine) includes any missing files from the achartengine snapshot included by gradle.
The snapshot version was missing core classes ChartFactory, GraphicalActivity, ITouchHandler, TouchHandler which are necessary for charting functionality.
Instead, the required files (acquired from https://github.com/ddanny/achartengine) have been manually added here for use by the application.
